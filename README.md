B2Eclipse
===========================

This is the set of Eclipse plugins for developing Bazel projects in Eclipse. Currently supports running in a language server mode only (through the [Eclipse JDT LS](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls)).

Repository structure
--------------------
- **com.salesforce.b2eclipse.jdt.ls** - the code which does all that Bazel-related stuff for building classpaths before they can be further processed by JDT.
- **com.salesforce.b2eclipse.repository** - here you can find the outcome of the build (packaged plugins).
- **com.salesforce.b2eclipse.tests** - integration tests for the jdt.ls plugin.
- **com.salesforce.b2eclipse.ui** - a plugin for the client (the one which is connected to the language server for code interactions). It's rather a simple connection provider to a language server, not a full-fledged UI plugin.

Future vision
-------------
Will be shipped separately as two independent features: standalone feature and as extension for Eclipse JDT LS.

Building from the command line
----------------------------

The following command will install [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) if necessary, then build the server into the  `/com.salesforce.b2eclipse.repository/target/repository` folder:
```bash
    $ ./mvnw clean verify
````
Note: currently, the build can only run when launched with JDK 8.

Features
--------------
* Code completion
* Code navigation
